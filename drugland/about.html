            <p>Drugland is Nigeria’s online pharmacy where you can buy drugs, medical and hospital equipment from registered pharmacies in Nigeria with the option of picking it up at the pharmacy or door delivery.

Drugland Nigeria enables easier and faster access to drugs. Pharmacies can reach more customers outside its locality, and reduce drug wastage due to expiry dates or low patronage. Patients can buy drugs confidently knowing that the pharmacy is registered and trustworthy.

We are making drugs more accessible and affordable by giving buyers the option to buy the same quality of drugs at cheaper prices from different pharmacies. We are making the process of getting medicines convenient, especially for patients who are ill, to have faster access to drugs.

The rate at which drugs expire in the industry is being reduced, and hence reducing waste, by increasing the market reach of every pharmacy. We are enabling Pharmacies cut down on cost by reducing the number of physical outlet a pharmacy needs to open just to increase the sales of drugs.

Thus, we are reducing the rate at which fake drugs are sold from “Chemists and unregistered Personnels”, and hence promoting registered pharmacies by giving people the opportunity to search for and find authentic pharmacies.

We are solving the problem of artificial scarcity of drugs by creating a directory of drugs and its availability across the country</p>
